It's important to have the latest firmware installed, to avoid a malicious actor exploiting an un-patched vulnerability.\nYou can usually do this by navigating to 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1, entering the admin credentials (on the back of you of your router, not your WiFi password!), and follow the instruction. Some newer routers update automatically" ]

Even if it is someone you trust, you cannot guarantee that their device has not been compromised in some way. Some routers offer the ability to enable a separate 'guest' network, which provides isolation and is able to expire after a given time frame. For a more comprehensive network, the same outcome can be achieved using a VLAN and separate access point." ]

It's hard to comprehend what your data will reveal, especially in conjunction with other data." ]
